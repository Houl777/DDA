## What's This
A GUI tool for Hyper-V's Discrete Device Assignment(DDA), which is supported since Windows Server 2016 TP4. DDA can be used to pass-through PCI-like devices(GPU, network adapter, etc.) to virtual machines, making the VM have direct access to the physical device. DDA can only be achieved by Powershell commandlines; this tool is based on these commands and provides a GUI.
